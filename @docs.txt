* (number x, vector y)
Returns y with all its items multiplied by x

+ (number x, number y)
Returns the sum of x and y

+ (vector x, vector y)
Cycles the shorter of x and y until it is the same length as the longer one, then returns a new vector where each item is the sum of the same item of x and y

, (* x, * y)
Evaluates x then returns y

- (number x, number y)
Returns x - y

/ (number x, number y)

\ (* x)
Outputs a newline ( \n on POSIX, \r\n on NT ) then returns x

^ (number x)
Returns x + 1

_ (number x)
Returns x - 1

| (number x)
Returns |x|

| (vector x)
Returns the square root of the sum of the squares of the items of x
